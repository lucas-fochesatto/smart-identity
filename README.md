# ID Bridge

Welcome to ID Bridge! ID Bridge is an application designed to facilitate seamless updating and notification processes when users make changes to their names or other relevant data. It uniquely connects user wallets to their data, acting as a key to manage and automate updates across different platforms or contracts.

## Features

- **Unique Wallet Integration:** Each user's wallet is uniquely connected to their data, ensuring secure and reliable updates.
- **Automated Cross-Updates:** Changes made by users are automatically propagated across relevant platforms or contracts, eliminating manual intervention.
- **Notification System:** Users receive notifications confirming successful updates and any relevant information.
- **Written in TypeScript:** The frontend of the application is primarily built using TypeScript, offering type safety and enhanced developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling, providing a customizable and utility-first approach to design.
- **Smart Contract Integration:** Smart contracts, written in Solidity, handle the backend operations securely and efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Solidity
- **Other Tools**: JavaScript (for frontend logic), Web3.js (for interacting with Ethereum blockchain)

</h4>

üß™ An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- ‚úÖ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- ü™ù **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- üß± [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- üî• **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- üîê **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.
